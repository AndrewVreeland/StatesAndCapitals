# States And State Capitals Trivia

## Overview
use ./gradlew run to run the program.

## Feature Tasks
- Get the unit tests up through the end of Advanced 2 working. (This means the Basic, Intermediate, Advanced 1, and Advanced 2 tests should all be working.) The results of your tests are printed at the end of testStatesAndCapitals() with "System.out.println(testResults);". "true" means a test is passing, while "false" means it is failing.
- Alternately, submitting any 19 working tests is fine too.
